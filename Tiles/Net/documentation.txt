///////////////////

The Tile Net receives either a Net instance (from pulse farmework), or a [nodes, relations] array.

Some properties in the nodes could be used in the visualziation:

name
color
urlImage			//if nodes have this property its image will be downloaded
weight 				//used for sizing the nodes, but any other numeric property could be used
description 		//used for tooltips (although any string property could be used)
colorsTable 		//an array with two arrays, [ [colors], [weights, normalized to sum = 1] ]
x 					//a numeric value that could be used for positioning the node
y 					//idem


Some properties in the relations could be used in the visualziation:

color
weight



///////////////////send and receive

NetView can receive different objects that allows to:

	set the network to be visualized. It's possible to send different networks through one session, if a network shares some of the nodes of the previous, these stay in same position, so it appears as if the network was modified.

	set the configuration of the Visualization, including physics model behavior, nodes and relations appereances (see below for more information on the configuration object)

	change aspects of the layout (such as clustering, see below for all the options)

	control the network in session time, doings things such as selecting nodes or simulating a rollover.


NetView will send information, such as nodes and relations being selected or hovered.


For a comprehensive documentation of all the Objects received and sent by NetView, check communication.json

In order to change any configuration value, or a few of them, only the object with such property or properties need to be sent.

example:

tile.sendData({type:"configuration", value:{nodes:{text_size:12, fixed_width:300}, physics:{attractionToCenter:true}}})

will change three configuration parameters while keeping the remaining with the same default value. It´s possible to change configuration properties many times during a session.




///////////////////layouts


to set a layout send an object with type "layout" and any of the following values:


clusters

clusters category (uses category property of nodes)

cloud (single disc arrangement)

xy (uses properties x and y of nodes)

x (uses property x of nodes)

y (uses property y of nodes)

free (free nodes from fixed x and/or y positions)

free x (frees nodes from x position)

free y (frees nodes from y position)

fit in window (keeps relative current positions and places all nodes within window boundaries)

center (moves stage to have the net in the center of screen)



example:

tile.sendData({type:"layout", value:"x"}) 

will fix horizontal position of nodes, requiring they have an x property with numeric value, while keeping vertical positions free.
